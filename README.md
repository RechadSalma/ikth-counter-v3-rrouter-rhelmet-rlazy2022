    -   / = which is the increment page which you can increment/decrement the displayed number
    -   /side = just some plain text
    -   /\* = error page
-   SEO for each page using react-helmet
-   react lazy loading the \<IncrementComponent> which contains teh huge bootstrap css file too
    -   It is the only component that is using bootstrap. So first paint was help a lot
