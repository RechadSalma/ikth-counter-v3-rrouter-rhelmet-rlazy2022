*********************** MISSION
- version03: webpack / react / react-router / react-helmet	iKskip = / workbox pwa / css css-grid
- simple increment page, & second will be calculator structure (non-working calculator because it will take to long)

*********************** LEFT OFF
-I finish doing the logic increment page. But lighthouse performance is not that great, so I would like to look at this a little bit before moving on to react lazy loading

*********************** DONE
- setup webpack using my webpack template

- set up three pages structure (react-router v6)
	- / index page for a simple increment functional component
	- /side as a simple calculator (non-working) compoment
	- /* error page
	-create layout component with header & footer
		-include links to test page not reload unneccessarily

-implement react-helmet

- do logic for the increment page
*********************** TODO

-Maybe test out react lazy loading components

- add some simple css to both pages
*********************** COMEBACK TO
-rename the app file to include react-helmet
	-assuming react-helmet was install successfully
